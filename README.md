# ⚙️ Robust Hyperparameter Optimization Workshop

**A hands-on guide to building reliable and validated ML optimization workflows.**

This workshop introduces participants to essential MLOps practices, focusing on **automating data quality validation and hyperparameter tuning**. They will learn to use `Pydantic` and `Pandera` to build automated data validation pipelines. The session also covers hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian optimization using the `Optuna` framework, including how to interpret and analyze the results.

## 🧩 Overview

What you will progressively learn:

1. **Enforce configuration integrity and validation** with `Pydantic`.  
2. **Validate your dataframe** using `Pandera` (schema-based data validation).  
3. **Optimize model performance** via Bayesian optimization using `Optuna`.  
4. **Combine all three** to create a robust end-to-end ML optimization workflow.

## 🚀 Quick setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/workshop-robust-hyperparam-tuning.git

cd workshop-robust-hyperparam-tuning
```

After forking the repository, create a new branch to work on your solutions:

```bash
# Create your branch
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    commit
    branch your-branch-name
    commit id: "your first commit"
```

## 🛠️ Installation

We use **[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** for the Python environment creation.

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

> 📦 All dependencies are defined in the `pyproject.toml` file.
---

```bash
# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # (on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate)
```
